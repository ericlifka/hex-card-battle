reap - kill a minion with <=3 health, power up kill all minions within range 1 from a target with <=3 health
    medium range, definitely not infinite
    
blink - teleport a minion up to 3 spaces, power up ?
    medium range
    

    
General concept: A lot of the spells 'normal' powers are the same or similar, like a 'firebolt' spell that does a damage 
    at short range but the upgrade versions of the spells differ, setting them apart and making them very different later
    in the game: Like one firebolt's upgrade is a meteor type aoe spell where another's is a firebreath style local aoe
    and yet another is a pyroblast style upgraded firebolt.


current idea: taking basic actions like 'move a unit 1' take one mana. All cards can be discarded to generate a mana, but
    most also have more powerful abilities.
    
Starting cards:
    Mana Crystal - Generate 1 mana
